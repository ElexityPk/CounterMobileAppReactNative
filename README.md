Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from nodejs.org.

npm (Node Package Manager): npm is usually included with Node.js installation. You can check if you have it by running npm -v in your terminal.

Git: You'll need Git to clone this repository. Download it from git-scm.com.

React Native CLI: If you don't have React Native CLI installed, you can install it globally by running npm install -g react-native-cli.

Xcode (for iOS development) or Android Studio (for Android development): Depending on your target platform, you'll need Xcode for iOS or Android Studio for Android. Follow the installation instructions for your specific platform on their respective websites.
